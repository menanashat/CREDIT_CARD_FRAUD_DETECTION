# CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION
in this project i have explored how to use machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud. By following the main steps involved in the project, we can develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions and prevent financial losses for businesses and consumers.
